About me -
My name is Ravi Kumar Lamsar, a front-end developer who happens to be a digital marketer from India.
- I'm a freelancer catering to local businesses with their website-related and digital product needs.
- I'm currently polishing my WordPress development skills and building my theme from scratch.
- On weekends or in free time, I write articles related to web and other media designing, SEO, content writing and other digital products. Soon I'll be writing about development too.
- And when I'm bored, I read articles about tech and animals (sometimes write about animals too).
